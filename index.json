In back propagation, only a small subset of the full gradient is computed to update the model parameters. The gradient vectors are sparsified in such a way that only the top-k elements (in terms of magnitude) are kept. As a result, only k rows or columns (depending on the layout) of the weight matrix are modified, leading to a linear reduction in the computational cost. Based on the sparsified gradients, we further simplify the model by eliminating the rows or columns that are seldom updated, which will reduce the computational cost both in the training and decoding, and potentially accelerate decoding in real-world applications. Surprisingly, experimental results demonstrate that most of time we only need to update fewer than 5% of the weights at each back propagation pass. More interestingly, the accuracy of the resulting models is actually improved rather than degraded, and a detailed analysis is given. The model simplification results show that we could adaptively simplify the model which could often be reduced by around 9x, without any loss on accuracy or even with improved accuracy.\n","date":1553875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553875200,"objectID":"6b7e46c53a7f9d30a1e3bbd7e2a1f983","permalink":"https://jingjingxupku.github.io/publication/my_pub1/","publishdate":"2019-03-30T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/my_pub1/","section":"publication","summary":"TKDE 2019","tags":[],"title":"Training Simplification and Model Simplification for Deep Learning: A Minimal Effort Back Propagation Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Commonsense Question Answering link\nCommonsense question answering aims to answer questions which require background knowledge that is not explicitly expressed in the question. The key challenge is how to obtain evidence from external knowledge and make predictions based on the evidence. Recent works either learn to generate evidence from human-annotated evidence which is expensive to collect, or extract evidence from either structured or unstructured knowledge bases which fails to take advantages of both sources. In this work, we propose to automatically extract evidence from heterogeneous knowledge sources, and answer questions based on the extracted evidence. Specifically, we extract evidence from both structured knowledge base (i.e. ConceptNet) and Wikipedia plain texts. We construct graphs for both sources to obtain the relational structures of evidence. Based on these graphs, we propose a graph-based approach consisting of a graph-based contextual word representation learning module and a graph-based inference module. The first module utilizes graph structural information to re-define the distance between words for learning better contextual word representations. The second module adopts graph convolutional network to encode neighbor information into the representations of nodes, and aggregates evidence with graph attention mechanism for predicting the final answer. Experimental results on CommonsenseQA dataset illustrate that our graph-based approach over both knowledge sources brings improvement over strong baselines. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy (75.3%) on the CommonsenseQA leaderboard.\nAuthors Shangwen Lv, Daya Guo, Jingjing Xu, Duyu Tang, Nan Duan, Ming Gong, Linjun Shou, Daxin Jiang, Guihong Cao, Songlin Hu\n","date":1551063842,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551063842,"objectID":"ec5eb54e8ebe256de568f1d9ec798541","permalink":"https://jingjingxupku.github.io/project/my-project-3/","publishdate":"2019-02-25T11:04:02+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-project-3/","section":"project","summary":"I have participated in a commonsense question answering project in MSRA.
