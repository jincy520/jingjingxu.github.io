      <title>An Auto-Encoder Matching Model for Learning Utterance-Level Semantic Dependency in Dialogue Generation</title>

      <description>Generating semantically coherent responses is still a major challenge in dialogue generation. Different from conventional text generation tasks, the mapping between inputs and responses in conversations is more complicated, which highly demands the understanding of utterance-level semantic dependency, a relation between the whole meanings of inputs and outputs. To address this problem, we propose an Auto-Encoder Matching (AEM) model to learn such dependency. The model contains two auto-encoders and one mapping module.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Sentiment-to-Sentiment Translation: A Cycled Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>The goal of sentiment-to-sentiment “translation” is to change the underlying sentiment of a sentence while keeping its content. The main challenge is the lack of parallel data. To solve this problem, we propose a cycled reinforcement learning method that enables training on unpaired data by collaboration between a neutralization module and an emotionalization module. We evaluate our approach on two review datasets, Yelp and Amazon. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain and Semi-Supervised Named Entity Recognition in Chinese Social Media: A Unified Model</title>
      <link>https://jingjingxupku.github.io/publication/cross/</link>

      <description>Named entity recognition (NER) in Chinese social media is an important, but challenging task because Chinese social media language is informal and noisy. Most previous methods on NER focus on in-domain supervised learning, which is limited by scarce annotated data in social media. In this paper, we present that sufficient corpora in formal domains and massive unannotated text can be combined to improve the NER performance in social media. We propose a unified model which can learn from out-of-domain corpora and in-domain unannotated text.</description>
